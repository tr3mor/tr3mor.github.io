          Dedicated to bolstering the company's observability infrastructure, I specialize in providing Observability-as-a-Service solutions tailored to developers' needs.
          Led the successful migration initiative from NewRelic to a combination of Datadog and OpenTelemetry (OTEL), resulting in enhanced visibility into our automated warehouse operations while significantly reducing cost. You may read about this project in [this](https://picnic.app/careers/picnics-migration-to-datadog-pavel-storozhenko) blog post.
          Revamped the centralized log collection system to enhance stability and flexibility of log collection pipelines, leading to substantial savings in compute resources across EKS clusters.
          As an SRE, I've spearheaded numerous projects aimed at optimizing AWS resources, streamlining Kubernetes orchestration, and implementing Infrastructure as Code practices using Terraform.
